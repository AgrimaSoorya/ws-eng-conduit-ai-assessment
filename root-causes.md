## Problem 1

**Problem**: The tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: To address the issues you're facing with tagging articles in your application, let's break down the problems and their potential solutions step by step.

### Problem 1: Tags are Broken Up into Individual Characters

**Analysis:**
The issue where tags are displayed as individual characters suggests that somewhere in the code, the list of tags is being incorrectly processed or stored. This is likely happening because the tags are being split incorrectly, possibly treating each character as a separate tag.

**Solution:**
1. **Review the Backend Processing:**
   - Check how tags are being processed when an article is created. Look for any logic that splits the tag string.
   - Ensure tags are correctly split by commas and trimmed for whitespace.

2. **Entity and DTO Adjustments:**
   - Ensure that the `Article` entity is correctly handling tags as an array of strings. Check the `tag_list` field to confirm it is an array and not a string.
   - Update the DTO (Data Transfer Object) that handles article creation to accept and process tags as an array.

3. **Frontend Adjustments:**
   - Ensure the tags input field on the frontend is correctly capturing a comma-separated list and sending it to the backend as an array.
   - Verify that the API request correctly serializes the tags as an array.

## Problem 2

**Problem**: New tags  are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags", even after a page refresh.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: To address the issues you're facing with tagging articles in your application, let's break down the problems and their potential solutions step by step.

**Analysis:**
The issue with new tags not appearing on the home page could be due to the tags not being saved correctly in the database or not being fetched properly when rendering the home page.

**Solution:**
1. **Database Insertion:**
   - Check the logic that handles the insertion of new tags into the `tag` table. Ensure that new tags are being inserted if they don't already exist.
   - Use a transaction to ensure atomicity when creating articles and adding new tags.

2. **Fetching Popular Tags:**
   - Ensure that the query fetching popular tags from the database is correct. It should retrieve tags based on their frequency of use or some other criteria.
   - Verify that the backend endpoint responsible for fetching popular tags is correctly implemented and returning the expected data.

3. **Frontend Update:**
   - Ensure that the frontend is making the appropriate API call to fetch popular tags and that it updates the UI correctly after receiving the data.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Backend Code:**
   - Update the method in your NestJS service that handles article creation to process the tags field correctly. Use a utility function to split and trim the tags string.
   - Ensure that the `Article` entity and `Tag` entity are correctly defined with a many-to-many relationship if applicable.

   ```typescript
   // Example utility function to process tags
   function processTags(tagsString: string): string[] {
       return tagsString.split(',').map(tag => tag.trim()).filter(tag => tag.length > 0);
   }
   ```

   - Use this function in your service when creating an article.

2. **Database Migration:**
   - If necessary, update your database migration scripts to ensure the `tag_list` in the `article` table is correctly defined as a JSON or text array, depending on your database setup.

3. **Frontend Code:**
   - Ensure that the tags input field is correctly capturing a comma-separated list and transforming it into an array before sending it to the backend.
   - Update the component responsible for displaying popular tags to fetch and render them correctly.

### Conclusion

By ensuring that tags are processed correctly both on the frontend and backend, and by verifying the database logic for storing and retrieving tags, you should be able to resolve both issues. Make sure to test the changes thoroughly to confirm that the expected behavior is achieved without introducing any regressions. Additionally, adhere to best practices in code quality and architecture to maintain the robustness of your application.
